DISCLAIMER
==========

The benchmarks in this application are loosely based on the TPC-A and
TPC-C standard benchmarks, but this application does not claim to be
a full or precise implementation, nor are the results obtained by this
application necessarily comparable to the vendor's published results.


Package Dependencies
====================
To compile this application, please make sure the following packages
and recommended versions are installed on your system.

        Package	  Version  From
	========  =======  ==================================
	gtk+	  1.2.10   ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.2
	xml2      2.5.4    ftp://xmlsoft.org/


For development purposes the following packages may also be required:

        Package	  Version  From
	========  =======  ==================================
	autoconf  2.57	   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf
	automake  1.6.3	   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake
	libtool   1.4.3	   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libtool

The above version are used for generating the source distributions with
are currently generated on a standard RedHat 9 installation. Older version
of these packages can sometimes be used, but could cause build problems.

To check the version number of the tools installed on your system,
use one of the following commands:

    $ autoconf --version
    $ automake --version
    $ libtoolize --version
    $ gtk-config --version
    $ xml2-config --version



Building software
=================

This application is portable to a great number of systems. Building
requires the following steps:

  step 1. Run configure to adjust to target platform
  step 2. Run make
  step 3. Run make install


Running configure
-----------------
The configure program will examine your system for various compiler
flags, system options etc. In some case extra flags need to be added
for the C compler to work properly.

For a full list of options, please run:

    ./configure --help


The most important arguments are:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX

   By default, `make install' will install all the files in
   `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify an
   installation prefix other than `/usr/local' using `--prefix', for
   instance `--prefix=$HOME'.


*  --enable-gui            build GUI applications (default)
*  --disable-gui           build GUI applications

   By default, both a command line and a graphical version of odbc-bench
   are build, if the GTK+ libraries can be found. If GTK could not be
   found, is unusable, or when --disable-gui is used, only a commandline
   version of the odbc-bench tool is build.


*  --enable-pthreads       build threaded applications (default)
*  --disable-pthreads      build non-threaded applications

   By default, a multithreaded application is build, unless
   --disable-pthreads is explicitly added to the commandline of configure.


*  --with-iodbc(=DIR)      Select iODBC support
*  --with-odbcsdk(=DIR)    Select OpenLink odbcsdk support
*  --with-unixodbc(=DIR)   Select UnixODBC support
*  --with-datadirect(=DIR) Select DataDirect support

   Specify one of these flags to state which driver manager you want
   to use. The optional =DIR argument should be pointed to the base
   installation directory of that Driver Manager. If the requested Driver
   Manager not found, the system will try to locate an appropriate Driver
   Manager in one of the system library paths.


*  --with-odbc-inc=DIR     Specify custom ODBC include directory
*  --with-odbc-lib=DIR     Specify custom ODBC lib directory
   
   If the above methods all fail, or an unknown driver manager is used, 
   these flags can be used to point to the correct include and lib paths.


*  --with-xml-prefix=DIR   Prefix where libxml is installed (optional)

   This flag is only needed when libxml2 is installed in a non-default
   directory.


Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>



A typical configure command looks something line:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-iodbc=/usr/local/iODBC \
    	--with-xml-prefix=/usr/local/xml2

The configure script will perform a large number of checks to find all
the header files, libraries and programs the build process needs.
