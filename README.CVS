Introduction
============
This document describes how to checkout a copy of the CVS tree for
development purposes. It also lists the packages that need to be
installed prior to generating the necessary scripts and Makefiles to
build the project.

CVS access is only needed for developers who want to actively track
progress of the odbc-bench source code and contribute bugfixes or
enhancements to the project. It requires basic knowledge about the
general layout of open source and GNU projects, the use of autoconf and
automake etc, which is beyond the scope of this document. 

If you have any questions, please email us at <odbc-bench@openlinksw.com>.


CVS Archive Server Access
=========================
OpenLink currently provides read-only CVS Archive access throught the
SourceForge.net servers:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/odbc-bench login

(The password is blank)

$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/odbc-bench \
  checkout odbc-bench


Package Dependencies
====================
To generate the configure script and all other build files necessary,
please make sure the following packages and recommended versions are
installed on your system.

	xml2      2.5.4    ftp://xmlsoft.org/

The above version are used for generating the source distributions with
are currently generated on a standard RedHat 9 installation. Older version
of these packages can sometimes be used, but could cause build problems.

To check the version number of the tools installed on your system,
use one of the following commands:

    $ autoconf --version
    $ automake --version
    $ libtoolize --version
    $ gtk-config --version
    $ xml2-config --version


Generate build files
====================
To generate the configure script and all related build files, use one
of the following commands:

    $ autoreconf --install

or use the supplied script in your CVS checkout directory:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

If the above commands succeed without any error messages, please use the
following command to check out all the options you can use:

    $ ./configure --help

Certain build targets are only enabled when the --enable-maintainer-mode
flag is added to configure.

Please read the files INSTALL and README in this directory for further
information on how to configure the package and install it on your system.


Submitting fixes and enhancements
=================================
Patches and new contributions can be submitted as diffs from the current
CVS archive by:

    $ cvs -z3 diff -uN > diffs

Patches and contributions can be send to the OpenLink odbc-bench source
archive manager at <odbc-bench@openlinksw.com> to be included the next
